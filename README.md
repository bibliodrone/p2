# Project 2
+ By: Gerald Walden
+ Production URL: <http://p2.geraldbrentwalden.me>

## Outside resources
I adapted 'validate.php', with my validation rules, to work along with 'Form.php' in my project.
I also made use of the error display HTML code from the class form-validation example to handle the error banner display in my 'index.php' file. The section is 
noted in the comments on the page. 
I used Stack Overflow for quick reference on how to trim leading zeros (if any) from the output message from 'Convert.php'.

## 3 Unique inputs

1. Unit Type: radio buttons for Distance, Temperature, Mass.
2. Conversion: select menu with options Imperial --> Metric and Metric --> Imperial.
3. Value: Text input for user-entered numerical value to use in conversion.

## Class
Form.php, Convert.php

I have tried to avoid any code-style divergences.
